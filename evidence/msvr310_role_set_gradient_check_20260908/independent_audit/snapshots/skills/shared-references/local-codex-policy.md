# Local Codex Model Policy

The user selected Codex-only execution on 2026-09-06. This policy overrides
inherited backend, model, effort, and cross-family routing examples in this
installed ARIS package. Preserve each workflow's substantive research steps.

- Writing and research reasoning run in the current Codex agent. Every newly
  created writer or reviewer agent explicitly uses `model: gpt-6-astra` and
  `reasoning_effort: max`, preserving the user's existing reasoning preference.
- A reviewer starts fresh with `fork_turns: none` and reads the supplied source
  artifacts directly. Pass the model and effort as separate parameters;
  `gpt-6-astra-max` is not a model identifier.
- Use the available native Codex agent tools. Do not create a separate
  user-visible task just to perform a review. Existing user authorization and
  the host's delegation rules still apply.
- Do not call Claude, Gemini, MiniMax, DeepSeek, Oracle, `llm-chat`, or any other
  external model backend for writing, research reasoning, or review. Do not
  install or activate review overlays. There is no automatic model fallback.
- If the requested Codex reviewer cannot start, record `REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`
  with the actual error. Do not silently switch models, lower effort, fabricate
  a reviewer response, or turn the executor's own judgment into an independent
  reviewer result. Continue only work that does not depend on that result.
- Fresh Codex reviewer output is independent context but the same model family:
  record `review_independence: same-family` and `acceptance_status: provisional`.
  A substantive PASS/WARN/FAIL may guide revisions and workflow progress; do
  not claim cross-family acceptance or start another model to obtain it.
- Deterministic tools, paper databases, web search, compilation, and plotting
  remain available. Record the actual model/effort on new review records and
  preserve historical records with their original attribution.

Explicit later user instructions can change this local policy.
